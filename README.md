# Audiable Ecommerce Website

This website is built using React, Tailwind, and Redux. I've designed it to be fully responsive, so it should look great on a wide variety of screen sizes. Specifically, it's been tested and optimized for screens with resolutions of 375px, 768px, and 1440px.

I've used Tailwind as our CSS framework, which means that the website should be fast to load and have a consistent look and feel across all pages. I've also used Redux to manage the state of the application, which makes it easy to update the website as needed and ensure that everything is running smoothly.
